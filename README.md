This is an assignment to learn the basics of git.
Git is a distributed version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is used to track changes in source code during software development.
Github is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, collaborating on code, and contributing to open-source projects

Some commands that commonly used to commit changes are: 
git init- this is to initialize the git repository onto a folder on your computer
git add . -adds all the filed that are going to be commited that is at the specific folder on your computer where it is initialized
git status-checks the status of the commit
git commit -m "first commit" - this is a command to name the commit or changes that are being made
git push -u origin main- this command is used to push the initial files or changed files to the repository
